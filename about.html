		<h2>WHO WE ARE</h1>
		<hr style="width:95%">
		<p>The Helping Hands Foundation is a non-profit organization, which works with children who are diagnosed with cancer. We work on two projects – the Accommodation Project and the Survivor Project. The Accommodation Project provides free accommodation to the child and the family during treatment in Dharamshalas surrounding the hospital and the Survivor Project works towards regular testing and rehabilitation of children who beat cancer. The Helping Hands Foundation is a fund raising entity and works in conjunction with Tata Memorial Hospital’s ImPaCCT Foundation.
					</p>
		<p>Our mission is to provide accommodation to every single child who comes to Mumbai for treatment thereby ensuring zero abandonment due to lack of accommodation.
